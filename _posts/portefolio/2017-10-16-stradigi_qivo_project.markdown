Qivo is a social network to share articles and media content about different topics and interests.
I participated in the development of the recommendation engine using different collaborative filtering
algorithms in order to yield personalized content recommendations for the users.
The second system I develop was an article extraction tool that extract an article from an web page and remove
boilerplate content.

The Technologies that I used in this project are:

- **Language**: Scala
- **Libraries**: Apache Spark, Goose
- **Databases**: MySQL
- **AWS Services**: Elastic Map Reduce, SQS
