The NEX band is a wearable device and a mobile application that can be used to control
different connected devices or applications. It also let you play and share different colorful light patterns.
In this project I participated in the development of the backend web service for the NEX band application.
The application communicates with different API services such as the IFTTT service and different other API and social networks,
to allow the interaction between the band and different service and connected devices. For example, one can use the band
to control a media player, control your house's lights, play a light pattern when there's is a specific type of
event happening in one of your social network, etc ... The technologies that I used in this project development are:

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Bottle (WSGI), Google App Engine
- **Databases**: Google Data Store
- **APIS**: IFTTT, Facebook, Instagram, and more
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Services
