I worked for CAE's civil aerospace division for the  Customer Support department. My responsabilities
in this position were to solve software and hardware issues on the customer's flight simulators. I worked as part of
the Generalists group, which were in charge of solving problems related with the simulation core software and
the interfaces between the systems and other electronic devices.
