description: Propulse Analytics offers a recommendation engine for e-commerce retailers. It uses Artificial intelligence to analyse product's images and customer purchases history in order to determine what the shopper is looking for, and what other products they might want to purchase. My work in this project is to design and develop the backend service and the recommendation engine that powers this application.
