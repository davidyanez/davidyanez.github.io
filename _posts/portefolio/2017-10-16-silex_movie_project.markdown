### Project: Movie Audio Track Information Retrieval

Research and develop algorithms to retreive information from movies audio tracks with the following features:

1. Audio Fingerprinting for movies: Be able to locate an audio sample in a database of movies, at the precise moment with millisecond precision.
2. Audio Cues Detection: Be able to detect and identify different cues in movies, from the movie audio track, such as explosions, gunshots, sirens etc..

### Project: Music Information Retrieval

Research and develop algorithms to retreive information from music with the following features:

1. Automatic identification of cues points in the music, when there's acoustical musical changes.
2. Automatic identification of acoustic similarities in the song.
3. Automatic remixing of songs using the song's cues points and acoustics similarities.
4. Automatic creation of song loops.
